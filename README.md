# Connecting REACT JS and NODE JS  (Sending data from node to react using API)
 
### Creating a React application for front end
    npx create-react-app applicationName

### Creating an Express application for back end
    npx express-generator applicationName

### This API allows the React application to communicate with the node application (run the code below inside the node project folder)
    npm i -save cors

### Install the default node_modules for both node and react, which comes along when you create a new application.
